# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

- This rep contains classes that emulate the behaviour of all the main data strcutures used all across the programming industry and exercises to test and understand their complexity and usefulness.

- It also contains the most important algorithms and some code with comments to understand their complexity.

- Throughout the course of this practice i learned how to measure time and space complexity, what determines it, how it fluctuates according to how the code was written and, most importantly, to recognize the optimal DS for specific tasks.
